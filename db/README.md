# FPDS Database Baseline

This directory holds the database and migration baseline for WBS `2.3`.

Current decisions:
- PostgreSQL is the baseline database.
- Migrations are SQL-first so the repo is not blocked on a framework or ORM choice.
- Primary keys use application-generated `text` ids for now, which avoids taking a UUID extension dependency before the runtime is chosen.
- Flexible candidate and canonical field payloads live in `jsonb` until the implementation needs stricter column-level expansion.
- `pgvector` is intentionally deferred from the first migration. Metadata-only retrieval fallback is allowed in early `dev`.

Files:
- `migrations/0001_initial_baseline.sql`: core schema and seed data
- `migrations/0002_admin_auth.sql`: DB-backed admin user, session, and login-attempt tables for `WBS 4.1`

How to apply when a database is available:

```powershell
psql $env:FPDS_DATABASE_URL -f db/migrations/0001_initial_baseline.sql
psql $env:FPDS_DATABASE_URL -f db/migrations/0002_admin_auth.sql
```

Notes:
- `psql` is available in the prepared local toolchain, but the migrations still need a reachable Postgres target.
- Use the connection target from `.env.dev.example` or `.env.prod.example`.
- Keep future migrations additive and append-only where possible.
- Put extension-specific or vendor-specific migrations in later numbered files.
